# Specta-Expecta Demo

This is the repository for live coding my presentation to the Ali team on 31 January 2019.

# How to use

This repository uses [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) to download the dependencies. You can install Carthage using this command in the terminal:

```
brew update
brew install carthage
```

If you have installed Carthage, you could update your Carthage installation with command below:

```
brew update
brew updgrade carthage
```

## Branches

I stored the main sample in `simple-tests` branch, but you could find my sample on the live demo in the `live-demo` branch.
